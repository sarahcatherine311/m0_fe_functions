# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
    I would say the thing I am good at is not procrastinating. The problem I struggle with is not taking enough breaks or walking away/asking for help when I encounter a problem.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
    It is a computer code that allows you to write a set of instructions for the computer to follow in order to give you the results you call/ask for.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
    Parameters are in the function definition and allow for multiple variables to be added to the function. 
    Arguments are in the call of the function and allow you to assign different data types to the variables(parameters) that you set in the function definition.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?
    Is the most basic explanation of a retun value that is saves the arguments that are in the function call as one string rather than printing the individual arguments in one line?
